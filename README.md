# Bbuu20's Recoil Handler

## Why was this archived?
This is a recoil script I made during my freshman year of college. It worked very well at the time, but the code is a mess because I didn't really know what I was doing. Due to the large amount of reported issues, and my lack of time/interest to fix them, the project was archived.

## How to run
Before you do any of this, note that this probably work anymore since there have been many game updates since the script was last worked on. Download build.zip from https://github.com/zebediahperkins/bbuu20-s-recoil-handler/releases/tag/1.0.0, and then run the executable. The gui will appear when the script has started.

## Description
An anti-recoil script for the video game "Rust"

## User Interface

## Hotkeys/Keybinds
The script uses hotkeys for quickly switching weapons, even while the script is not in focus. These hotkeys can be rebound.
